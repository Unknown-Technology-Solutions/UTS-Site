    <div class="intro">
        A lot. Transitioning from highschool to university is a big step. Now I have to not only think of my job, but a career as well, along with the constant worry of my classes. <br />
        CIST gave me the opporuntity to get exposed to various companies in my career field, along with how to work with my peers, network, and gave me a place to not be stressed as much.

    <div class="intro heading">Advice</div>
        Take it easy, but take it. <br />
        Everything can seem overwhelming at times, but as evident by even myself succeeding, it is extremely possible.<br />
        Find your people.<br />
        This can be a club, some random people, or a group of friends you've known forever.<br />
        Use the resources.<br />
        I don't just mean use CAPS, or the H&K building. I mean talk to your dean and teachers, befriend them. Visit the campus coffee shops, walk around campus. Getting out and about campus will have a positive impact on your mental health.
